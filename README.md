### Data Scientist | AI/Ml Engineer | Data Analyst | Backend Developer | Open-Source Enthusiast

I'm a passionate Data Scientist and AI/ML Engineer with hands-on experience building intelligent systems using machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing. I specialize in developing scalable models using frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Python ‚Äî from research to real-world deployment.

My work bridges the gap between data and decision-making. I use tools like Power BI to transform raw data into actionable insights, and I'm equally comfortable developing full-stack solutions with Node.js and Nestjs.

‚úÖ Machine Learning & Deep Learning (CNNs, NLP, Transfer Learning)

‚úÖ PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn

‚úÖ Data Analysis & Visualization with Power BI

‚úÖ Python for Data Science

‚úÖ AI/ML Model Deployment & API Integration

‚úÖ Backend Development with Node.js

I'm always excited to collaborate on innovative AI solutions and data-driven projects. Let‚Äôs connect and create something impactful!
